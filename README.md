*   # Dot product
    * Indicates how close two vectors are
        * vectors have both a magnitude and direction
          * magnitude is like how much or
                * like the distance away from 0
                * can be thought of as absolute value or
                * squared value because it results in positive
            * Direction is like which way
                * like up, down, left, right
            * An example
                * start=0
                * left(<-) is defined as positive (opposite of what we usually think)
                * right(->) is defined as negative (opposite of what we usually think
                    * if a person walks 10 steps to the left <- from start then it can be represented as +10
                    * if a person walks 10 teps to the right -> from start then it can be represented as -10
              * magnitude does not take into consideration direction so 10 steps is 10 steps regardless of it is to the left or right of start meaning that the magnitude of the +10 and the -10 are both 10
                  * if move 10 steps to left first then 10 steps right then
                  * mgnitude of stpes is 10+10=20 total steps taken
              * direction does take into consideration which way that 10 steps is walked so in our example left 10 is +10 and right 10 is -10
                  * if move 10 steps to left first then 10 steps right then
                  * direction from start is 10-10=0 which means even though you took 20 steps technically you didn't move in any direction away from start
  
    * using vectors A=[3,4], B=[7,5], C=[-3,-4] with A as our refrence and left <- is negative right -> is positive
        * magniudes **between (distance)** points in vectors
            * A,B
                * total distance
                    * d=√((x~2~ - x~1~)^2^ + (y~2~ - y~1~)^2^)
                        * (x~2~ - x~1~)^2^ lets create a new varible to contain this value call it x~3~
                            * x~2~ - x~1~ = 7 - 3 = 4
                            * 4^2^ = 16 == x~3~
                        *  (y~2~ - y~1~)^2^ lets create a new varible to contain this value call it y~3~
                            *  y~2~ - y~1~ = 5 - 4 = 1
                            *  1^2^ = 1 == y~3~
                        * √((x~2~ - x~1~)^2^ + (y~2~ - y~1~)^2^) == √(x~3~ + y~3~)
                        * √(x~3~ +y~3~) = √(16+1)= **√17=~4**
      
            * A,C
                * total distance
                    * d=√((x~2~ - x~1~)^2^ + (y~2~ - y~1~)^2^)
                        * (x~2~ - x~1~)^2^ lets create a new varible to contain this value call it x~3~
                            * x~2~ - x~1~ = -3 - 3 = -6
                            * (-6)^2^ = 36 == x~3~
                        *  (y~2~ - y~1~)^2^ lets create a new varible to contain this value call it y~3~
                            *  y~2 - y~1 = -4 - 4 = -8
                            *  (-8)^2^ = 64 == y~3~
                        * √((x~2~ - x~1~)^2^ + (y~2~ - y~1~)^2^) == √(x~3~ + y~3~)
                        * √(x~3~ + y~3~) = √(36+64)= **√100=10**
              * 10>4 so distance A,C > A,B
       
        * directions between points in vectors
            *  A,B
                * 
  
            *  A,C
