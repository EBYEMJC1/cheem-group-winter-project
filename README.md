*   # Dot product
    * Indicates how close two vectors are
        * vectors have both a magnitude and direction
          * magnitude is like how much or
                * like the distance away from 0
                * can be thought of as absolute value or
                * squared value because it results in positive
            * Direction is like which way
                * like up, down, left, right
            * An example
                * start=0
                * left(<-) is defined as positive (opposite of what we usually think)
                * right(->) is defined as negative (opposite of what we usually think
                    * if a person walks 10 steps to the left <- from start then it can be represented as +10
                    * if a person walks 10 teps to the right -> from start then it can be represented as -10
              * magnitude does not take into consideration direction so 10 steps is 10 steps regardless of it is to the left or right of start meaning that the magnitude of the +10 and the -10 are both 10
                  * if move 10 steps to left first then 10 steps right then
                  * mgnitude of stpes is 10+10=20 total steps taken
              * direction does take into consideration which way that 10 steps is walked so in our example left 10 is +10 and right 10 is -10
                  * if move 10 steps to left first then 10 steps right then
                  * direction from start is 10-10=0 which means even though you took 20 steps technically you didn't move in any direction away from start
  
    * using vectors A=[3,4], B=[7,5], C=[-3,-4] with A as our refrence and left <- is negative right -> is positive
        * magniudes **between (distance)** points in vectors
            * A,B
                * total distance

                        * (x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub>)<sup>2</sup> lets create a new varible to contain this value call it x<sub>3</sub>
                            * x<sub>2</sub> - x<sub>1</sub> = 7 - 3 = 4
